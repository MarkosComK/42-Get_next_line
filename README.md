	🚀 This project consists of coding basic C functions (see below), which are then compiled
	into a library for use in other projects of the cursus.


## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The Get-next-line is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the Get-next-line**

To compile the function, run:

```shell
$ cd path/to/get-next-line && cc get_next_line.c get_next_line.h get_next_line_utils.c
```

```C
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

## 📋 Testing

**1. I haven`t coded a tester yet, but you can make your own test for each function. Here some third party testers that you can use.**
